  {
    q: "How is this different from buying off-the-shelf software?",
    a: "Off-the-shelf tools make you change how you work to fit the software. We do the opposite — we engineer the system around your existing workflows, people and goals, and connect it to the tools you already rely on.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the difference between a chatbot and an AI agent?",
    a: "A chatbot answers questions. An AI agent gets work done: it understands the request, plans the steps, and uses your systems — CRM, inventory, accounts, email, WhatsApp — to complete the task, asking a human for approval whenever the stakes are high.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is it safe to let AI act on our business data?",
    a: "We design every agent with guardrails: it only accesses the systems and data you allow, high-impact actions require human approval, and every decision is logged so you can review exactly what happened and why. We start with low-risk, high-value tasks and expand from there.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you work with the tools and data we already have?",
    a: "Yes. We integrate with your existing POS, accounting, booking and communication tools through APIs, and migrate data out of spreadsheets so nothing gets lost in the move.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does it take and what does it cost?",
    a: "It depends on scope. After a free discovery consultation we give you a clear roadmap, timeline and estimate before any commitment. Many businesses start with one of our ready-made platforms (ZynRest, ZynStay, ZynDesk, ZynCRM) and customize from there to go live faster.",
  },
  {
    q: "We're not technical. Will our team be able to use it?",
    a: "That's the point. We design friction-less interfaces for the people who use them every day, and we train your team during launch so adoption is smooth.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will we see progress along the way?",
    a: "Every week. We work in focused sprints with weekly demos — real progress, continuously, with no black-box development and no surprises at the end.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens after launch?",
    a: "We don't disappear. We monitor, support, optimize and keep evolving your system as your business grows. Most of our work is long-term partnership.",
  },
